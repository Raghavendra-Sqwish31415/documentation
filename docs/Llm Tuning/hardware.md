# Hardware Considerations for LLM Tuning

## Overview

This page covers hardware requirements and considerations for efficient Large Language Model tuning.

## GPU Requirements

### Memory Considerations
- **VRAM Requirements**: Different model sizes require different amounts of GPU memory
- **Memory-Efficient Training**: Techniques to reduce memory usage during training

### Compute Optimization
- **Mixed Precision Training**: Using fp16/bf16 to accelerate training
- **Gradient Accumulation**: Managing batch sizes with limited memory

## Multi-GPU Training

### Data Parallelism
- Distributing training across multiple GPUs
- Synchronization strategies

### Model Parallelism
- Splitting large models across multiple devices
- Pipeline parallelism techniques

## Hardware Recommendations

### For Different Model Sizes
- **Small Models** (< 1B parameters)
- **Medium Models** (1B - 10B parameters)  
- **Large Models** (> 10B parameters)

### Cost-Performance Analysis
- Cloud vs on-premise considerations
- Optimal hardware configurations for different use cases

## Monitoring and Profiling

### Performance Metrics
- GPU utilization monitoring
- Memory usage tracking
- Training throughput optimization

### Debugging Tools
- NVIDIA profiler integration
- Memory debugging techniques
